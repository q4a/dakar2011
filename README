You can use Dev-Cpp or VC++ 2010. There is project files for both.

Compile under Linux
-------------------

First you need a patched and compiled Irrlicht (both are checket by the configure script).
And you need also several libraries to be installed (this is also checked by the configure).

Then do the following:
./configure
make

There is not make install. To run the compiled binary you need to download the binary
package and overwrite the binaries in there.
