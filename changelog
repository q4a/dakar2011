Build 2.1.1.1839

- Add offset manager: there can be big stages where the stage length is over 100Km.
                      In this case the the "float" type has precision lose. And there
                      can be drawing problems. We the offset the camera is always near
                      to the origo (max. 2500 m).
- Modified thread handling, seems to be much more stable
- For the new stages we use real height datas
- The real height datas are stored in our format, no heightmap images are used anymore, only for editing
- Faster AI. New reset for them: now reset back to the last reached AI point, insted of reset in place.
  it was necessary because in some new stages there are big ravines and the AI driven cars have stucked.
